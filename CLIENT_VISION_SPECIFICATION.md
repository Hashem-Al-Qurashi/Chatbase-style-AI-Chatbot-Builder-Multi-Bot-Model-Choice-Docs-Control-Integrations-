# Client Vision Specification - Simple Chatbot SaaS Platform

## Document Purpose
Complete specification of client requirements for a simplified chatbot builder platform replicating early-stage Chatbase functionality.

**Client Profile**: Developer who lacks time to build their own solution  
**Target Market**: Non-technical users frustrated with complex AI agent builders  
**Business Model**: Micro-SaaS focused on simplicity over feature richness

## Problem Statement

### Market Context
- **Chatbase Evolution**: Originally simple chatbot builder, now evolved into complex "AI agent building" with excessive features
- **Market Gap**: No simple, focused chatbot builder for non-technical users
- **Client Frustration**: Wants OLD simple version of Chatbase without complexity
- **Business Opportunity**: Believes market exists for "just a chatbot builder" without bells and whistles

### User Pain Points
- Current AI chatbot platforms are too complex for small businesses
- Non-technical users intimidated by enterprise-grade interfaces
- Need simple upload → configure → chat workflow
- Want Stripe-level simplicity, not AWS Console complexity

### 4. Critical Privacy Feature System ⚠️

#### 4.1 Core Privacy Requirements

**The Problem Client Identified**:
> "If the AI is working as a RAG giving support, if someone uploads everything, the chat will give everything even if it is confidential. That brings complexity around what resources we make the chatbot learn from vs what resources it can give to clients."

#### 4.2 Two-Tier Content Classification

**"Learn Only" Sources (Private/Training Only)**:
- Chatbot uses content for context and understanding
- **NEVER** shows content to users
- **NEVER** cites these sources
- **NEVER** reveals their existence
- Used only for improving response quality and context

**"Citable" Sources (Public)**:
- Chatbot can quote directly from these sources
- Can show excerpts in responses
- Can provide source attribution
- Can link back to original sources

#### 4.3 Implementation Requirements

**User Interface**:
- Toggle switch for each uploaded source: "Learn Only" vs "Citable"
- Clear visual distinction between source types
- Bulk operations for multiple sources
- Source type editing capability

**Technical Requirements**:
- **Server-side enforcement** (cannot be frontend-only)
- Database-level separation of content types
- RAG system respects privacy flags
- Audit trail for privacy compliance

#### 4.4 Example Use Case
**Small Business Scenario**:
- **Upload**: Internal pricing guidelines (set as "Learn Only")
- **Upload**: Public FAQ document (set as "Citable")
- **Result**: Chatbot understands pricing context but only shows/cites FAQ content to customers

### 5. Chatbot Interaction System

#### 5.1 Chat Interface Requirements
- Clean, modern chat interface
- Real-time messaging
- Typing indicators
- Message history
- Mobile-responsive design

#### 5.2 RAG-Powered Responses
- Intelligent responses based on uploaded knowledge
- Context-aware conversations
- Source attribution for citable content
- Fallback responses when knowledge insufficient

#### 5.3 Embeddable Widget
- JavaScript widget for client websites
- Customizable appearance (colors, position)
- Easy integration (copy-paste code)
- Cross-domain functionality
