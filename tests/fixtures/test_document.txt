This is a test document for validating the content type mapping fix.

The document contains multiple paragraphs to ensure proper chunking and processing.

Key features to test:
1. Content type mapping from txt to text/plain
2. Document processing without "Unsupported source type" errors
3. Successful chunking and knowledge source creation
4. Proper status progression: pending → processing → completed

If this test succeeds, the content type mapping fix is working correctly.
