**Context**: Phase 3 RAG implementation revealed critical gap between logic testing and system integration. Logic tests passed 100% but integration tests found 6 critical errors.

**Decision**: Mandatory integration testing for all components before marking complete

**Problem Identified**:
- Logic tests gave false confidence (mocked everything)
- Real system integration found: import errors, missing dependencies, interface mismatches
- 6 critical issues found that would have caused production failures
- Integration success rate: 0% initially, improved to 80% after systematic fixes

**Solution**: Two-Phase Testing Requirement
1. **Logic Testing**: Validate algorithms and core functionality
2. **Integration Testing**: Validate with real Django system, models, database

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Every component must pass both logic AND integration tests
- Integration errors documented in INTEGRATION_ISSUES_LOG.md
- Resolution steps preserved in ERROR_RESOLUTION_LOG.md
- Cannot mark component complete until integration tests pass
- Django system check must pass after component integration

**Testing Methodology**:
```bash
# Required tests for every component:
python manage.py check                    # Django integration
python -c "from module import Component"  # Import validation
pytest tests/integration/                 # System integration
```

**Documentation Requirements**:
- All errors found during integration documented with:
  - Exact error message and detection method
  - Root cause analysis
  - Resolution steps taken  
  - Prevention strategy for future
- Clear ‚úÖ COMPLETED status only after integration validation

**Success Metrics Achieved**: ‚úÖ **EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS**
- **Error Detection**: 8 integration issues found and documented (expanded during testing)
