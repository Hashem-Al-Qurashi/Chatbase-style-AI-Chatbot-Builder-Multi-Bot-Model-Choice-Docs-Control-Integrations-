This is a test document for the RAG system.

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot is designed to:
1. Process documents and extract knowledge
2. Generate embeddings for semantic search
3. Retrieve relevant context for user queries
4. Generate AI responses based on the retrieved information

Key features:
- Privacy-first design with citable vs learn-only content
- Real-time chat with streaming responses
- Cost optimization with OpenAI API
- Enterprise-grade security and monitoring

This document should help test the knowledge retrieval functionality.
